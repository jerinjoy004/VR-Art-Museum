- [ ] Performance tab ready for profiling

### 2. Load Testing Script
```javascript
// Copy and paste this into browser console
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = './vr-museum-tester.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

### 3. Initial Verification
- [ ] A-Frame scene loads without errors

## 📊 Performance Testing (5-10 minutes)

### Baseline Performance
- [ ] **Empty Scene Test**: Load gallery with 0 artworks
  - Target: 60+ FPS, <100MB memory
- [ ] **Small Gallery**: Test with 5-10 artworks
  - Target: 45+ FPS, <200MB memory
- [ ] **Medium Gallery**: Test with 20-30 artworks
  - Target: 30+ FPS, <400MB memory
- [ ] **Large Gallery**: Test with 50+ artworks
  - Target: 25+ FPS, <600MB memory

### Performance Metrics
```javascript
// Run in console during testing
const monitorPerformance = () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log({
      fps: Math.round(1000 / (performance.now() - lastFrame)),
      memory: Math.round(performance.memory?.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576) + 'MB',
      artworks: document.querySelectorAll('[artwork]').length
    });
  }, 2000);
};
```
